# Quarterback-Heatmap-Plot
Given an quarterback and year, it will show a plot of a football field with a heatmap on top of it of where the quarterback threw the ball the most in that season and his completion percentage in those areas of the field.

The code does require web scraping from Pro-Football-Reference so some quarterbacks may not work for specific years for they might not have that data or its not available.

For most quaterbacks it does work though and from my knowledge should work for years 2010 and over.
